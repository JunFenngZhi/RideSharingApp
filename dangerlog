1. In views.py, @login_required decorator does not work with classes. So those pages can be accessed without login.
Solution:
    Added login_required() to the corresponding as_view() in urls.py

2. User can register a vehicle even if they already have one. (but a user can have only one car)
Solution:
    Change the title to "Edit Vehicle Info" if the user already has a vehicle.

3. A user without vehicle can also claim a open ride. But doing so would result in data corruption.
Solution:
    Hiding the link to "search ride as a driver" in the home page if the user does not have a vehicle.

4. A driver can still edit the info for his vehicle, while he still have incomplete ride.
Solution:
    Hiding the link to "Edit Vehicle Info" in the home page if the user is a driver and have confirmed rides.

5. A user can join a ride owned by himself as a sharer.
Solution:
    Added checks to exclude such case from searching result.

6. We avoided a lot of illegal user operations by hiding the links. But a malicious user may still be able to forge a http post or get request to those illegal area.
Solution:
    TODO: add checks on every form.

7. We are using the default login page, which do not have a captcha and may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
Solution:
    TODO: add captcha.
